        <h3>Privacy Policy - Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Bandit or its creators are in no way affiliated with Reddit (the service), Reddit Inc or any of its subsidiaries.
            Bandit accesses user-generated content of Reddit via its API and authenticates the user (if they wish to do so) using OAuth2 authentication.
            Anonymous usage statistics are collected for improving the quality of the application.
            The free version of the application serves advertisements. Some of the advertising services may use cookies or collect personal information for behavioral retargeting.
            Additional information may be gathered by Reddit, Inc. Be advised of their separate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy">privacy policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Login Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Bandit authenticates the user (if they wish to do so) to Reddit using Oauth2 authentication. Authentication is not necessary and the services can be accessed anonymously.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bandit never handles users' login credentials, such as usernames or passwords.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bandit acts on behalf of the user after user has granted the rights to do so. What Bandit does on behalf of the user is shown to the user before granting or denying the access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p>Login is done using an integrated WebView, which essentially opens a web page where the user may input their login credentials to Reddit in order to authenticate. This is comparable to accessing Reddit website directly on your browser and as such is covered under Reddit's privacy policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bandit holds a renewal token for maintaining authentication information. User can revoke the token by logging out, clearing the application data or removing the application.</p>
